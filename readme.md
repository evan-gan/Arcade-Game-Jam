# How to submit to the jam!
The following instructions will show you how to submit your game in the proper format. 

#### Please read the entirety of the instructions carefully so you submit in the correct format!

## Setup your submission:
1. **Create a folder named {Game name}-{Your name} _(Replace the brackets with your info)_**
2. **Create a folder named source**
  - Put all the source code to your game in the folder you just created. _(Tip: Remember to remove any personal information)_
3. **Create a folder named build if your game needs a build to run.**
  - If your game needs a build, put your build inside it.
4. **Create a file within that folder named README.md**
  - Fill this file out with instructions on how to setup and play your game. 
  - If you have never used markdown before or prefer rich text editors, here is [a nice basic one](https://mark.barelyhuman.dev/).
  - Make sure to include links to dependencies & photos if necessary.
  - Don't assume any knowledge. (Ex. Don't assume the person reading it has any knowledge of how to install your game.)
